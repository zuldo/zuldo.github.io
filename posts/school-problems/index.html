			<p>Here I will list problems with "school" and attempt to process related trauma. Based partially on direct observation, partially on indirect observation, partially on extrapolation.</p>
<ul>
<li>This list is not exhaustive. And what I've picked up on is biased towards mostly containing information related to the reference classes I'm in.</li>
<li>The categories are not exclusive, I put subitems under whichever parents I think they fit the best under.</li>
<li>I might update this list over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>I quote "school", "student", and "teacher" because those words are lies when describing what I'm talking about here.</p>
<p>This post is currently mostly speaking to children and teenagers stuck in "school". As in, when I write "you" that's the people I'm referring to.</p>

<h1>Body autonomy and discomfort</h1>
<ul>
<li>Bathrooms.<ul>
<li>Usage restricted by "teachers".<ul>
<li>Encourages dehydration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tiny room size.</li>
<li>Unusable sinks.<ul>
<li>Cold water.</li>
<li>Not enough space.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Forced physical presence.</li>
<li>Arbitrary restrictions on body usage.<ul>
<li>Stimming/fidgeting.</li>
<li>Looking direction.<ul>
<li>"Look at the person speaking.".</li>
<li>"Keep your eyes forward.".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clothing limitations.<ul>
<li>Keeping hoodie hoods down.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Uncomfortable chairs.<ul>
<li>And as far as I know forced chair usage. I never actually tried standing up in "school" for the purpose of avoiding discomfort.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Emotions and health</h1>
<ul>
<li>Gaslighting.<ul>
<li>See most of this post.</li>
<li>Everything adults say about "schools" that doesn't admit that those are inherently hostile eventually turns into lying to pretend like they're not.<ul>
<li>Your parents are very probably complicit in this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Here's some anti-gaslighting:<ul>
<li>You're allowed to feel emotions, including pain and anger.</li>
<li>You deserve freedom.</li>
<li>Other people controlling your body is a violation of freedom. Punishing you for not keeping it in specific states counts as controlling it.</li>
<li>You're allowed to get hurt by things that other people don't seem to get hurt by.</li>
<li>If you want more help/support/advice, feel free to <a href="/meta">contact me</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Surpression of pain.<ul>
<li>Proportial, sane responses to "school"-induced pains are disincentivized.</li>
<li>"Everyone goes through this.".</li>
<li>"There are people who have it worse.".</li>
<li>"You just have to push through the pain.".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Breaking mental systems for feelings about self.<ul>
<li>Pushing "students" into unstable, dysfunctional identities.<ul>
<li>Self-worth based on grades.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Food.<ul>
<li>Many "schools" don't even feed their "students" to begin with.<ul>
<li>Selling food is not feeding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Withholding or not displaying information about ingredients.<ul>
<li>See also "Against autistic people.". Eating uncomfortable ingredients feels even worse when they're a surprise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sometimes "students" are forced to choose between risking malnutrition and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnism">eating dead bodies</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tiring schedules.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Freedom</h1>
<ul>
<li>The inherent violation of freedom that is forcing people to be at locations, and the one that is forcing them do certain things.</li>
<li>Discouragement of "free time".<ul>
<li>Homework with no upper limit of possible effort to put into it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Social</h1>
<ul>
<li>Disencouragement of respecting children towards adults.<ul>
<li>It's painful to both respect someone and accept them being subjected to large amounts of pain. Most adults choose the latter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Forced participation in social webs and surpressing some social emotions.<ul>
<li>"Everybody gets to join.".</li>
<li>"We're all friends here.".</li>
<li>"Why do you not like [person]?".</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Prejudical discrimination</h1>
<ul>
<li>General/several.<ul>
<li>Not counteracting hostility.<ul>
<li>Lots of teen cishet people literally use "gay" as an insult. There are lots of teen cishet people in "schools".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spreading misinformation and withholding important information.<ul>
<li>About sex and gender.</li>
<li>About attraction.</li>
<li>About available medical care.<ul>
<li>Gender-related treatments such as HRT.</li>
<li>How to get medical care in general.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Against autistic people.<ul>
<li>[See "Arbitrary restrictions on body usage.". Actually, see most of "Body autonomy and discomfort".]</li>
<li>Bright lights.</li>
<li>Loud noises.</li>
<li>Unreliable schedules.</li>
<li>In some cases active hostility.<ul>
<li>"Autistic people lack empathy.".</li>
<li>"People tend to avoid eye contact when lying.".</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Against women.<ul>
<li>Clothing limitations determined by gender or sex (not inherently against women specifically, but I've only observed it against women in practice).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Against queer people.<ul>
<li>Forced usage of changing rooms segregated by AGAB or body.</li>
<li>Forced clothing.<ul>
<li>All types of distinguishing between different people which I have observed "school" uniforms being designed and enforced for are:<ul>
<li>School year.</li>
<li>AGAB or sex (sometimes gender, but that's an exception).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bathrooms segregated by AGAB or sex.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Anti-rationality</h1>
<ul>
<li>Encourages or causes certain biases.<ul>
<li>"<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NMoLJuDJEms7Ku9XS/guessing-the-teacher-s-password">Guessing the Teacher's Password</a>".</li>
<li>Pretends to "teach" many things it actually doesn't, giving people an inaccurate idea about those things.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Dark-Side-Epistemology">Anti-epistemics</a> to protect lies and hide problems.<ul>
<li>This is an inherent part of all gaslighting, not just "schools".</li>
<li>Ignoring obviously counterproductive schedules.</li>
<li>Using anti-epistemics is directly "taught" in the form of "debates", by encouraging ability to make untrue things sound true without separation between that fake "belief" used for lying/reality-ignoring, and actual beliefs.<ul>
<li>Encourages assuming and practicing communication <a href="https://srconstantin.github.io/2020/02/18/defensiveness.html">adversarially</a>.</li>
<li>This is different from teaching people how to manipulate others. "Schools" make their "students" conflate political manipulation with cooperative truth-seeking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Makes people surpress their emotions and desires. See "Emotions and health".<ul>
<li>Healthy emotion processing is part of being rational. "Schools" damage healthy emotion processing.</li>
<li>Caring about things is an expression of freedom. "Schools" make "students" bad at doing things they care about, because that's what happens when your "choices" are controlled by other people for years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
