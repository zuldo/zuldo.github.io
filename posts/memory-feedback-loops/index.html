			<p><a href="http://bewelltuned.com/">BeWellTuned</a>'s <a href="http://bewelltuned.com/pause_your_feedback_loops">Pause Your Feedback Loops</a> describes <strong>mental feedback loops</strong>. The basic idea is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At any given time, your mind is probably keeping track of dozens of activities and issues, and struggling to keep all of them under control.</p>
<p>This happens on each scale, ranging from "is my makeup OK?" to "am I doing something useful with my life?".</p>
<p>You can recognize these feedback loops by the emotions which they consistently generate. What you are looking for is repeatedly having new thoughts and emotions about the same topic, often in changing directions depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Another clue is what kind of thoughts automatically enter your attention, especially when you are idle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I recommend reading the entire thing before reading this.</p>
<hr />
<p>There's a specific type of feedback loop I've noticed, which I call memory feedback loops. They are the loops that repeat a certain piece of information in my mind for the purpose of not forgetting it. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repeating a phone number in your mind until you've written it down.</li>
<li>An idea you got in the shower.</li>
<li>Something you realised you want to talk about later in the middle of a conversation.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Feedback loops take up mental space and processing power. The more loops I have active at a time the slower I think, and the worse my working memory is.</p>
<p>I want to think quickly and have good working memory. BeWullTuned describes in full generality how to pause any feedback loops. Pausing just memory feedback loops is easier.</p>
<hr />
<p>Write things down. Write for myself only. The only purpose is to point my future selves to the thing my present self is thinking about. Write down everything that does not trivially leave my short-term memory. It doesn't matter whether I'll find it stupid, obvious, impractical, or otherwise unnecessary later. The purpose is to free up my present self's mind, not to be useful to my future self (though that's often a [useful] side effect).</p>
<p>If I keep having thoughts about something after writing it down, write more. Sometimes writing about something will make me think more about it. This is fine on a small scale, but if it creates a new feedback loop, adjust my phrasing to be minimally inspiring while still pointing to the right thing. And remove attention from it as soon as you've written it down. Focusing my attention on something else might help, just be careful to choose something without feedback loops on its own.</p>
<p>How do you remember later to read the things you wrote? At this point it's a habit for me. Use a writing medium where it's very easy to see the latest entries. Read them at any time. If you want to think more about them, do so. Maybe write them down somewhere more long-term. If you want, have specific time spans dedicated to this part. I don't have as much experience with the reading part; for me, the writing part is more important.</p>
