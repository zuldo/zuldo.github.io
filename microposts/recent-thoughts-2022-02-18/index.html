			<h1>What I've been learning and thinking about recently</h1>
<ul>
<li>Efficient time usage for most people is probably what looks from a naive perspective like inefficient time usage.<ul>
<li>Hobbies.</li>
<li>In general things that exist to <em>take up time</em> such as board games.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Socializing is often driven by inherently social, or by no specific, goals.<ul>
<li>I learned this from observing other people having conversations that were so obviously not about things such as arriving at conclusions it overpowered my biases for assuming such things.</li>
<li>Also, ironically, from observing socialization in fiction.<ul>
<li>People really do just do things because they're fun!<ul>
<li>The reason I took so long to really get this is probably related to dissociation and such.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Not being <a href="/glossary#genuinity">genuine</a> is <em>difficult</em>.<ul>
<li>And very rarely worth it.</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Dark-Side-Epistemology">If you once tell a lie, the truth is ever after your enemy.</a></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Specific situations makes not hurting people difficult even if you don't actually want them to hurt.<ul>
<li>And some arguments/debates/fights are positive feedback loops of things other than truth-seeking and policy-designing.<ul>
<li>Are communication algorithms that aren't anger-like much more complicated than anger-like ones, and so those tend to get used by default?</li>
<li>Or is it literally just about sticking to teams?</li>
<li>I should read more about psychology about politics and "politics".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It gets easier with practice, though, as you recieve more evidence about how to do it well.</li>
<li>I wish I was able to teach the parts of this that I have.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Boundaries are there because you want to keep a relationship existing.<ul>
<li>Without them, either the relationship collapses or you push away the other person.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Epistemic humility is <em>difficult</em>.<ul>
<li>Especially about things that are instrumentally important, even though that's nonsensical.</li>
<li>Especially when talking with other people.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The ways in which I construct and name concepts are unusual.<ul>
<li>"valid"</li>
<li>"lazy"</li>
<li>"preference"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many debates/arguments are <em>redundant</em>, exist in social reality but not reality.<ul>
<li>You <em>already know</em> your relevant preferences well enough to make acceptable approximations of optimal tradeoffs.<ul>
<li>Example: respecting people's chosen pronouns. Figuring out how to act regarding chosen pronouns takes like <em>five minutes</em>. You only need to talk to other people about it to know what ratios of [not hurting people] versus [not caring about people sufficiently different from oneself] are common around you, and how people react to them. The rest you can extrapolate (assuming you already know what pronouns and preferences and pain are).<ul>
<li>Like there really are not discussions about whether to respect people's chosen pronouns. The "whether" implies making decisions as opposed to [whatever <em>is</em> going on, as mentioned before I have not yet studied "politics"].</li>
<li>If you believe I made any object-level argument about pronoun usage here you misinterpreted this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
