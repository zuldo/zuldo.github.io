        <p>I used to not want to <a href="/glossary#self-pushing-forcing">push</a> myself. Because I thought that meant <a href="/glossary#self-pushing-forcing">forcing</a> myself.</p>
<p>I want to push myself more.</p>

        <h2>Some things that might improve my mental health</h2>
<p>These are observations from my memory and notes of activities that potentially improve my mental health.</p>
<ul>
<li>[redacted]<ul>
<li>kind of "do what you want"</li>
<li>probably related to <a href="https://mindingourway.com/guilt/">replacing guilt</a><ul>
<li>kind of lets me only feel bad about doing things that i genuinely regret</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>gratitude journaling<ul>
<li>i just enter date and hour (if changed since last entry) then short descriptions of things i'm grateful of</li>
<li>loose definition of "gratitude"; can include e.g. things i'm proud of. it's less "gratitude journaling", more "healthy &amp; happy stuff journaling"</li>
<li>no forcing myself. if i don't want to make an entry i don't make one</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>pushing myself to talk with people<ul>
<li>not too much. only when it feels like a good idea</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>having inspiring conversations<ul>
<li>i've gotten lots of this from joining a certain community</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mQmx4kQQtHeBip9ZC/internal-double-crux">internal double crux</a><ul>
<li>most internal conflicts are probably not fundamentally contradictions of (terminal) values<ul>
<li>see also <a href="/posts/preferences-and-value-drift">Preferences and value drift</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>trying to "make myself" feel happy from friends being happy when i don't automatically<ul>
<li>might help to explicitly wonder stuff like "what is bad about this situation?" or "what would be better than this?"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>being less afraid of <a href="/posts/preferences-and-value-drift">not-actually-value-drift</a></li>
<li>asking friends if they will tell me if i'm hurting them (and them answering that they will)</li>
<li>reconnecting with people i haven't talked with in a while</li>
<li>doing the <a href="https://www.notion.so/Values-exercise-f65d0f7fcedc4a0c88dc2222ad763070">Values exercise</a><ul>
<li>i think the process was more impactful than having the result, at least so far</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>reading about several things:<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip/p/r6kzvdia4S8TKE6WF">craving</a></li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>"doing nothing"<ul>
<li>as in <a href="/posts/compute-io-bound">computing</a></li>
<li>as in <a href="https://spacelutt.com/solitudefirst">solitude</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>making cool stuff<ul>
<li>writing bash script automating various parts of using this blog</li>
<li>drawing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>more conversations in public/non-private spaces<ul>
<li>can jump in and out of conversations</li>
<li>can talk with several people at once</li>
<li>makes your relationships legible to other people</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>figuring out more about how i get attracted in various ways to people<ul>
<li>in the broad sense of "attracted" which includes stuff like platonic and aesthetic attraction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>started reading "The Courage to Be Disliked"</li>
</ul>

        <a href="#4">4</a>
        <p>Related to <a href="/posts/empathy-overuse">this</a>: I often have trouble balancing directly observed evidence about myself and priors about "most people".</p>

        <p>The more you understand something the more proxies for tracking it you can come up with. And if someone tries to <a href="/glossary#goodharting">goodhart</a> your current proxy you can create a new one.</p>

        <p>Note about a certain failure mode.</p>
<ol>
<li>You declare something about yourself that you endorse (or think you do).<ul>
<li>Examples:<ul>
<li>"I'm a kind person."</li>
<li>"I don't actually care about other people."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Probably occurs mostly with things that feel morality-related.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are parts of you that don't follow the pattern.<ul>
<li>This is a consequence of declaring instead of observing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Those parts are forced out of the places in your mind where the "you" doing the endorsement are.<ul>
<li>Such as becoming subconscious because the endorsement is conscious.</li>
<li>See also <a href="http://bewelltuned.com/tune_your_emotional_processing">this</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Less conscious control, "akrasia", internal conflict, self-hate.</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't know how to avoid this in general. But stuff in the general cluster pointed to by "self-acceptance"/"self-love" seems to help. Also in some cases possibly [redacted]. <!-- uhs --></p>

        <p>I learned recently that for massage to be effective you don't have to rub, it's enough to just press. And found that just this made massaging myself easier. And partially because of that, partially because of Seriously Giving It A Shot, I've found out that self-massage is totally worth it. And if you never tried it before it's worth it to do so now.</p>

        <p>I encountered somewhere the idea that habits are reinforced by attention. I've been explicitly and deliberately been testing this on the habit of biting my nails, which I've done for a <em>long</em> time. Will probably learn more about this in the future.
