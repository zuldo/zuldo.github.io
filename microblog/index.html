        <p>Note about a certain failure mode.</p>
<ol>
<li>You declare something about yourself that you endorse (or think you do).<ul>
<li>Examples:<ul>
<li>"I'm a kind person."</li>
<li>"I don't actually care about other people."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Probably occurs mostly with things that feel morality-related.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are parts of you that don't follow the pattern.<ul>
<li>This is a consequence of declaring instead of observing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Those parts are forced out of the places in your mind where the "you" doing the endorsement are.<ul>
<li>Such as becoming subconscious because the endorsement is conscious.</li>
<li>See also <a href="http://bewelltuned.com/tune_your_emotional_processing">this</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Less conscious control, "akrasia", internal conflict, self-hate.</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't know how to avoid this in general. But stuff in the general cluster pointed to by "self-acceptance"/"self-love" seems to help. Also in some cases possibly [redacted]. <!-- uhs --></p>

        <p>I learned recently that for massage to be effective you don't have to rub, it's enough to just press. And found that just this made massaging myself easier. And partially because of that, partially because of Seriously Giving It A Shot, I've found out that self-massage is totally worth it. And if you never tried it before it's worth it to do so now.</p>

        <p>I encountered somewhere the idea that habits are reinforced by attention. I've been explicitly and deliberately been testing this on the habit of biting my nails, which I've done for a <em>long</em> time. Will probably learn more about this in the future.
