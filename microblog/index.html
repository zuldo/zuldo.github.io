        <h1>What I've been learning and thinking about recently</h1>
<ul>
<li>Efficient time usage for most people is probably what looks from a naive perspective like inefficient time usage.<ul>
<li>Hobbies.</li>
<li>In general things that exist to <em>take up time</em> such as board games.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Socializing is often driven by inherently social, or by no specific, goals.<ul>
<li>I learned this from observing other people having conversations that were so obviously not about things such as arriving at conclusions it overpowered my biases for assuming such things.</li>
<li>Also, ironically, from observing socialization in fiction.<ul>
<li>People really do just do things because they're fun!<ul>
<li>The reason I took so long to really get this is probably related to dissociation and such.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Not being <a href="/glossary#genuinity">genuine</a> is <em>difficult</em>.<ul>
<li>And very rarely worth it.</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Dark-Side-Epistemology">If you once tell a lie, the truth is ever after your enemy.</a></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Specific situations makes not hurting people difficult even if you don't actually want them to hurt.<ul>
<li>And some arguments/debates/fights are positive feedback loops of things other than truth-seeking and policy-designing.<ul>
<li>Are communication algorithms that aren't anger-like much more complicated than anger-like ones, and so those tend to get used by default?</li>
<li>Or is it literally just about sticking to teams?</li>
<li>I should read more about psychology about politics and "politics".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It gets easier with practice, though, as you recieve more evidence about how to do it well.</li>
<li>I wish I was able to teach the parts of this that I have.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Boundaries are there because you want to keep a relationship existing.<ul>
<li>Without them, either the relationship collapses or you push away the other person.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Epistemic humility is <em>difficult</em>.<ul>
<li>Especially about things that are instrumentally important, even though that's nonsensical.</li>
<li>Especially when talking with other people.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The ways in which I construct and name concepts are unusual.<ul>
<li>"valid"</li>
<li>"lazy"</li>
<li>"preference"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many debates/arguments are <em>redundant</em>, exist in social reality but not reality.<ul>
<li>You <em>already know</em> your relevant preferences well enough to make acceptable approximations of optimal tradeoffs.<ul>
<li>Example: respecting people's chosen pronouns. Figuring out how to act regarding chosen pronouns takes like <em>five minutes</em>. You only need to talk to other people about it to know what ratios of [not hurting people] versus [not caring about people sufficiently different from oneself] are common around you, and how people react to them. The rest you can extrapolate (assuming you already know what pronouns and preferences and pain are).<ul>
<li>Like there really are not discussions about whether to respect people's chosen pronouns. The "whether" implies making decisions as opposed to [whatever <em>is</em> going on, as mentioned before I have not yet studied "politics"].</li>
<li>If you believe I made any object-level argument about pronoun usage here you misinterpreted this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

        <a href="#9">9</a>
        <p>Self-deception is <em>bad</em>.</p>
<p>There's a "productivitiy trick" that goes something like, "Tell yourself that you will only do a minute of [procrastinated activity]. This makes it easier to keep going, so you can keep [doing the activity] for more than a minute."</p>
<p>In other words "Lie to 'your'self about how long you indent to [do something], to get 'your'self to give you control that you then use to break that self-promise."</p>
<p>There's a reason you're not doing the thing in question. Admit to yourself what "your" reasons are instead of fighting "your"self and you can do what all of you <em>actually want</em>, whether or not that's the original activity.</p>
<p><strong>Do not attempt to "trick yourself".</strong> <strong><em>Cooperate.</em></strong></p>

<p>Here is the output of my 5 minutes.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>ask people what i do that makes them happy</li>
<li>ask people what sort of mistakes i tend to do</li>
<li>try different things with different people, or at different times</li>

<li>don't demand things from people</li>
<li>relationships should be freeing, not limiting</li>
<li>reaching out to people is a better idea than it feels like</li>

        <h2>Recent insights, realizations, ideas, observations, things I want to keep in mind</h2>
<ul>
<li>"do not ruminate on things you can't control" is pretty good advice<ul>
<li>how to apply in practice?<ul>
<li>probably helps a bit to actually accurately gauge how much influence you have over a situation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>lots of singers, voice actors, and trans people learn unusually much about using their voice. what about relearning how to use other things taken for granted like voice is?<ul>
<li>walking</li>
<li>relaxing</li>
<li>dealing with emotions</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pfibDHFZ3waBo6pAc/intentionally-making-close-friends#Advice">making</a> <a href="https://spacelutt.com/freefriends">friends</a><ul>
<li>keeping friends</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>you're allowed to both X and be afraid of not-X<ul>
<li>in general, you're allowed to be afraid</li>
<li>and to do things without justifying them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://spacelutt.com/Social/Discovering%20Community.html">communities are cool</a></li>
<li>having people directly addressing me in group conversations feels nice</li>
<li>no complaining challenge: don't complain about anything for a period of time<ul>
<li>means you're pushed to either drop feelings of dissatisfaction or act on them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the more time i spend in solitude the more interesting thoughts i have that may lead to interesting conversations</li>

        <h2>Some things that might improve my mental health</h2>
<p>These are observations from my memory and notes of activities that potentially improve my mental health.</p>
<ul>
<li>[redacted]<ul>
<li>kind of "do what you want"</li>
<li>probably related to <a href="https://mindingourway.com/guilt/">replacing guilt</a><ul>
<li>kind of lets me only feel bad about doing things that i genuinely regret</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>gratitude journaling<ul>
<li>i just enter date and hour (if changed since last entry) then short descriptions of things i'm grateful of</li>
<li>loose definition of "gratitude"; can include e.g. things i'm proud of. it's less "gratitude journaling", more "healthy &amp; happy stuff journaling"</li>
<li>no forcing myself. if i don't want to make an entry i don't make one</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>pushing myself to talk with people<ul>
<li>not too much. only when it feels like a good idea</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>having inspiring conversations<ul>
<li>i've gotten lots of this from joining a certain community</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mQmx4kQQtHeBip9ZC/internal-double-crux">internal double crux</a><ul>
<li>most internal conflicts are probably not fundamentally contradictions of (terminal) values<ul>
<li>see also <a href="/posts/preferences-and-value-drift">Preferences and value drift</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>trying to "make myself" feel happy from friends being happy when i don't automatically<ul>
<li>might help to explicitly wonder stuff like "what is bad about this situation?" or "what would be better than this?"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>being less afraid of <a href="/posts/preferences-and-value-drift">not-actually-value-drift</a></li>
<li>asking friends if they will tell me if i'm hurting them (and them answering that they will)</li>
<li>reconnecting with people i haven't talked with in a while</li>
<li>doing the <a href="https://www.notion.so/Values-exercise-f65d0f7fcedc4a0c88dc2222ad763070">Values exercise</a><ul>
<li>i think the process was more impactful than having the result, at least so far</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>reading about several things:<ul>

        <p>Related to <a href="/posts/empathy-overuse">this</a>: I often have trouble balancing directly observed evidence about myself and priors about "most people".</p>

        <p>The more you understand something the more proxies for tracking it you can come up with. And if someone tries to <a href="/glossary#goodharting">goodhart</a> your current proxy you can create a new one.</p>

        <p>Note about a certain failure mode.</p>
<ol>
<li>You declare something about yourself that you endorse (or think you do).<ul>
<li>Examples:<ul>
<li>"I'm a kind person."</li>
<li>"I don't actually care about other people."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Probably occurs mostly with things that feel morality-related.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are parts of you that don't follow the pattern.<ul>
<li>This is a consequence of declaring instead of observing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Those parts are forced out of the places in your mind where the "you" doing the endorsement are.<ul>
<li>Such as becoming subconscious because the endorsement is conscious.</li>
<li>See also <a href="http://bewelltuned.com/tune_your_emotional_processing">this</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Less conscious control, "akrasia", internal conflict, self-hate.</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't know how to avoid this in general. But stuff in the general cluster pointed to by "self-acceptance"/"self-love" seems to help. Also in some cases possibly [redacted]. <!-- uhs --></p>

        <p>I learned recently that for massage to be effective you don't have to rub, it's enough to just press. And found that just this made massaging myself easier. And partially because of that, partially because of Seriously Giving It A Shot, I've found out that self-massage is totally worth it. And if you never tried it before it's worth it to do so now.</p>

        <p>I encountered somewhere the idea that habits are reinforced by attention. I've been explicitly and deliberately been testing this on the habit of biting my nails, which I've done for a <em>long</em> time. Will probably learn more about this in the future.
