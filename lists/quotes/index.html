<p>A common mistake here is to think that if you never experience negative emotions about other people, it will somehow automatically make you a kind person. But what <em>actually</em> happens is that it makes you a person who <em>doesn't know that they are not kind</em>.</p>

<p>Grasping does feel pretty intimately tied to anxiety, although I don’t think it’s the only way you can have it. I think grasping is anytime you feel a <em>need</em> for something to go a particular way. It happens anytime an outcome seems <em>unacceptable</em>.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>And when I’m in that state, anxiety always feels like the answer. On some level I obviously know that rushing more won’t help anything; it’s just that anxiety is this <em>mode</em>, this way of being that’s pretty persuasive. When I’m inside of it, it feels like in order to reach any of my goals I just have to be holding onto them really hard, and if that doesn’t work, well it’s because I wasn’t holding onto them <em>hard enough</em>. </p>
<p>It’s all this sort of hellish catch-22. The anxiety, the grasping is <em>itself</em> what causes the pain.</p>

<p>Probabilities express uncertainty, and it is only agents who can be uncertain. A blank map does not correspond to a blank territory. Ignorance is in the mind.</p>

<p>wait hmm this isn't about quantum superpositions this is about probability theory i think</p>

<p>[redacted]</p>
<p>human brains can do wayyy more than just stay stuck in the spaces they learned to operate in when they were young</p>
<p>like sure 3d brains have less computation available than 4d brains but theyre still <em>brains</em>, they can still learn stuff even if they have hardware limitations</p>
<p>and its absolutetly possible for humans to visualize &amp; comprehend 4d space</p>
<p><br>
iirc humans spend several years when theyre young on among other things learning how space &amp; physics works locally on an intuitive level</p>
<p>and after learning that and growing &amp; becoming more powerful for many years they can repeat that process with slight changes to the environment way quicker than they learned it the first time around</p>
<p>ive spent 17 hours on playing <a href="https://4d-miner.github.io/">4d miner</a>, probably less than 50 hours total of thinking about 4d stuff over my lifetime, and sure i dont understand it as well as i understand  3d space, but i understand it well enough to on the fly generate analogies between 4d-in-3d visualization and 3d-in-2d visualization (as i did yesterday when e.g. explaining stuff about rotation &amp; block slices to [redacted])</p>
<p><br>
if someone with better general mental software for handling physical spaces spends more time than me on playing this &amp; other 4d games theyll get way further than me in understanding it</p>
<p>and eventually theyll understand it well enough to be able to easily visualize stuff</p>
<p>like, this is possible, and many of y'all <em>can learn it</em>, and that's really cool</p>
<p>&lt;/rant> :yuuehehe:</p>
